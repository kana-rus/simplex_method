//! Simplex method is a widely used algorithm for solving linear programming problems.
//! Here, "linear programming problem" is generally represented by:
//! ```ignore
//!     maximize:  c x
//!     s.t.  A x <= b, \forall{i}, x_i >= 0
//!     ( x, b, c \in R^n,  A \in R^m Ã— R^n ) 
//! ```
//! 
//! This can be transformed to "standarnd form":
//! ```ignore
//!     maximize:  c x
//!     s.t.  A' x' = b, \forall{i}, x'_i >= 0
//!     ( A' = [A | E] )
//!     ( x' = (x_1, ..., x_n, s_1, ..., s_m)^t )
//! ```
//! 
//! Here `s_1, ..., s_m` are called "slack variable"s, introduced for following transformation:
//! 
//! ```ignore
//!     a_{i1} x_1 + a_{i2} x_2 + ... + a_{in} x_n  <=  b_i
//! --> a_{i1} x_1 + a_{i2} x_2 + ... + a_{in} x_n  + s_i  = b_i,  s_i >= 0
//! ```
//!
